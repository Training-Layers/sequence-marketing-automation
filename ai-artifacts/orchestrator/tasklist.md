Hereâ€™s a **granular checklist** in Markdown format to help your team implement **Tracks** and **Orchestrators** in short, testable steps:

---

# **Implementation Checklist**

## **Phase 1: Basic Track Structure**
1. **Create Initial Interfaces**  
   - [x] Define a minimal `TrackDefinition` interface (name, tasks).  
   - [x] Define a minimal `TrackTaskDefinition` interface (taskName, optional input mapper).

2. **Implement Track Runner (MVP)**  
   - [x] Write a simple `runTrack(trackDef)` function.  
   - [x] Inside this function:  
     - [x] Initialize `prevOutput = null`.  
     - [x] Iterate through tasks in order.  
     - [x] Apply `inputMapper` if any, else use empty object.  
     - [x] Call a mock `executeTask(taskName, input)` that returns dummy output (e.g., `{...}`).

3. **Test a Simple 2-Task Track**  
   - [x] Create a small `trackDef` with two tasks (like "mockTask1", "mockTask2").  
   - [x] Provide a basic `inputMapper` to pass data from task1 output to task2.  
   - [x] Run `runTrack(trackDef)` and verify the data flows.  
   - [x] Confirm logs or console output show the chain is correct.

## **Phase 2: Typed Track Enhancements**
1. **Introduce Type Safety (Optional)**  
   - [x] If you have a `TaskRegistry`, define `TaskInput<T>`, `TaskOutput<T>`.  
   - [x] Update `TrackTaskDefinition` to reference typed input/output.  
   - [x] Update `runTrack` to properly pass typed data.

2. **Add Basic Error Handling**  
   - [x] Catch errors in `executeTask`.  
   - [x] Ensure `runTrack` logs or collects the error to help debugging.  
   - [x] Test by intentionally throwing an error in a mock task.

## **Phase 3: Orchestrator Skeleton**
1. **Define Orchestrator Interfaces**  
   - [x] Create `OrchestratorDefinition` (name, tracks, optional `trackDependencies`, optional `trackInputMappings`).  
   - [x] Plan how to store outputs from each track (an `outputs: Record<string,any>`).

2. **Implement Orchestrator Runner**  
   - [x] Write a `runOrchestrator(def)` function that:  
     - [x] Builds a `depCount` dictionary from `trackDependencies`.  
     - [x] Identifies "ready" tracks (0 dependencies left).  
     - [x] Calls `runTrack` for each ready track in parallel.  
     - [x] Decrements dependency counts for other tracks after one completes.  
   - [x] Return a final `outputs` object with each track's output.

3. **Test Orchestrator with Parallel Tracks**  
   - [ ] Create two independent mock tracks (e.g., "TrackA", "TrackB").  
   - [ ] Set zero dependencies.  
   - [ ] Confirm they run in parallel, and both outputs appear in the final result.  
   - [ ] Check logs or console messages to verify concurrency.

4. **Add a Single-Task Orchestrator Call**  
   - [x] Provide a small `runSingleTask(taskName, input)` utility.  
   - [ ] In the orchestrator test, after the parallel tracks, call a final single task.  
   - [ ] Confirm final merging logic works.

## **Phase 4: Data Mapping & More Complex Logic**
1. **Add Cross-Track Dependencies**  
   - [ ] Test a scenario where `TrackB` depends on `TrackA`.  
   - [ ] Confirm orchestrator waits for `TrackA` to finish before starting `TrackB`.

2. **Track-Level Input Mappings**  
   - [ ] For each track, if you need to pass dynamic input, define a `trackInputMappings[trackName]` function.  
   - [ ] Test that the orchestrator indeed passes the correct output from one track into another track's input.

3. **Refine Error Handling**  
   - [ ] Decide on an orchestrator policy if one track fails:  
     - Stop everything vs. continue unaffected tracks?  
   - [ ] Implement the chosen approach in `runOrchestrator`.

## **Phase 5: Composite Tracks (Optional)**
1. **Add a `CompositeTrackDefinition`**  
   - [ ] Provide a `subTracks` array plus a `mergeStrategy`.  
   - [ ] Implement a mini-runner for composite tracks (if needed).  
   - [ ] Test parallel sub-tracks inside a single "composite" track.

2. **Test Composite Merging**  
   - [ ] Provide an example scenario combining outputs from multiple sub-tracks.  
   - [ ] Confirm the final merged result is correct.

## **Phase 6: Integration with Actual Tasks**
1. **Hook Up Real Task Registry**  
   - [ ] Replace mock `executeTask` with real calls to your Trigger.dev tasks or wherever tasks are defined.  
   - [ ] Ensure input types match what tasks expect.  
   - [ ] Ensure output is consistent with what the track/orchestrator logic needs.

2. **Full Dry-Run**  
   - [ ] Execute a small real scenario with your new track and orchestrator code.  
   - [ ] Confirm logs, final outputs, and error handling all work end-to-end.

3. **Performance & Logging**  
   - [ ] Optionally add logs at each step (start of a track, end of a track, error, etc.).  
   - [ ] Validate no major performance issues if tasks run in parallel.

## **Phase 7: Final Polishing**
1. **Documentation**  
   - [ ] Document how devs should add new tasks to a track.  
   - [ ] Document orchestrator usage (dependencies, parallel runs, final merges).

2. **Edge Cases & Cleanup**  
   - [ ] Test empty track scenario (no tasks).  
   - [ ] Test one track depends on multiple tracks.  
   - [ ] Validate all error paths.

3. **Roll Out**  
   - [ ] Merge into main codebase.  
   - [ ] Provide minimal usage examples to the team.  
   - [ ] Celebrate the new orchestration layer working in short, testable bursts!
